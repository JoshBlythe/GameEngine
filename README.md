# GameEngine

This project is for Games Engine programming, First day I Initalised Cmake and committed it to GitHub. This project will be
built on further as the unit progresses. 

The Engine is based off Unity, the entities list is basically the gameObject list. The componets are the components of
the gameObjects, and the transforms are the transforms of the gameObject. 

The Entity class will have a function which will interate through the list and draw each object held inside it.
